SUS.compute.R
=============

Some simple R code to compute the score of System Usability Scale (SUS) responses.

Info on SUS: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_usability_scale

Each column represents one of the 10 questions, each row a participant.
WARNING: sus.compute will not clear your data for you!

Preparation:

This function takes as input just the responsesâ€”make sure to clean your data!
If you have gathered responses from online software there probably exist headers. Make sure to turn headers on.
Moreover, set strings to n/a to avoid as.numeric factorising the responses. You don't want to calculate the score of the indices!

> sus.demo <- read.csv("~/Documents/R/Demo Usability evaluation - Demo SUS.csv", header=T, na.strings='n/a')

Make sure to feed into the function only the rows containing the system whose SUS you want to calculate:

> my.data <- sus.demo[which(sus.demo$The.system.I.evaluated.was.a.=="Web app (in-browser app)"),]

Make sure to feed into the function only the columns containing SUS responses, e.g. by removing other demograohic info:

> demo.sus <-my.data[c(-1,-2,-3,-4)]

To run from the console you would do something like:

> sus.score <- sus.compute(demo.sus)

> sus.score
